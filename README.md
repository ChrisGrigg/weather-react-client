Developed using node version 12.16.1 and npm version 6.14.4.

Example of things that could be done with more time:

	- move all url's to config file to target: local, dev, uat, prod api's
	- move weather related code to it's own component that is instantiated in App.js
	- add http interceptor to add JWT and error interceptor for global error handling
	- send error's to error logging such as Azure Application Insights
	- implement Redux for global state management
